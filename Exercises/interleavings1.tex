\begin{nontutequestion}
Suppose process \SCALA{P} performs $m$ atomic actions (sequentially), and
process \SCALA{Q} performs $n$ atomic actions (sequentially).  When \SCALA{P}
and \SCALA{Q} are run in parallel, how many interleavings of atomic actions
are there?
\end{nontutequestion}
%
\begin{nontuteanswer}
There are a total of $m+n$ atomic actions.  The number of ways of choosing
which $m$ of these belong to~\SCALA{P} is
\[
\left( \begin{array}{@{}c@{}} m+n \\ m \end{array} \right) =
\frac{(m+n)!}{m! n!}
\]
