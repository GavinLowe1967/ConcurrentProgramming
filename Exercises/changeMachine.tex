Design a \emph{change machine} process with signature:
%
\begin{scala}
def ChangeMachine(inPound: ?[Unit], out5p: ![Unit], out10p: ![Unit], out20p: ![Unit])
\end{scala}
%
where communications on the channels correspond to the insertion of \pounds 1,
and the output of a 5p, 10p or 20p piece, respectively.  It should be willing
to accept \SCALA{inPound} whenever it had a zero balance.  It should offer
the environment the choice between how it wants the change, subject to the
condition that it should not output coins of more value than it has received.
