\begin{question}
The CSO construct \SCALA{alt} is rather like the external choice operator
$\extchoice$.  Describe a couple of ways in which they are different.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\SCALA{alt} operates over channels, whereas $\extchoice$ operates over
arbitrary processes.  For example, in CSP you can have a process such as
\[
(P \parallel Q) \extchoice (R \intchoice S)
\]
but you can't achieve a similar effect using \SCALA{alt}. 

\item
In CSO, if the outport of a channel is involved in an \SCALA{alt}, the inport
may not simultaneously be involved in an(other) \SCALA{alt}.  But in CSP it's
fine to have a process such as
\[
(c!x \then \ldots \extchoice \ldots) \parallel (c?x \then \ldots \extchoice
\ldots). 
\]
\end{itemize}
