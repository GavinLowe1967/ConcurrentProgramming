\begin{question}
The \emph{region labelling problem} is a problem that occurs in image
analysis.  

Assume that each pixel in an image is represented by a boolean: $true$
indicates that the pixel is lit, and $false$ represents that the pixel is
unlit.  The states of the pixels are stored in an array
%
\begin{scala}
  val a = new Array[Array[Boolean]](N,N);
\end{scala}

Let the \emph{neighbours} of a pixel be the (up to four) pixels
immediately above, below, left or right of it.  (Note that the top and bottom
rows are not considered adjacent.)  Two pixels are in the same
\emph{region} if (and only if) there is a path from one to the other, where
all pixels in the path are lit, and successive pixels in the path are
neighbours.  For example in the image below, there are three regions.
%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2cm]{regions.eps}
\end{center}

The aim of this question is to identify the distinct regions and to allocate
each a unique label.  Each label will be of type:
%
\begin{scala}
  type Coord = Tuple2[Int,Int];
\end{scala}
%
More precisely, the label for each region will be the coordinates of the
left-most pixel in the top row of the region, i.e., the one that is smallest
according to the lexicographic ordering:
%
\begin{scala}
  def smaller(p1:Coord, p2:Coord) : Boolean = {
    val i1=p1._1; val j1 = p1._2; val i2=p2._1; val j2 = p2._2;
    (i1<i2 || i1==i1 && j1<j2)
  }
\end{scala}

An algorithm to calculate this is initially to label each pixel with its own
coordinates; and then to repeatedly relabel each pixel with the smallest label
of itself or its lit neighbours:
%
\begin{scala}
  for((i1, j1) <- neighbours(i,j))
    if(a(i1)(j1) && smaller(label(i1)(j1), label(i)(j)))
      label(i)(j) = label(i1)(j1)
\end{scala}
%
where \SCALA{neighbours(i,j) : List[Coord]} gives the neighbours of
\SCALA{(i,j)} in some order.

%%%%%

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Write a concurrent program to solve the region labelling problem.  The program
should use \SCALA{p} worker processes (you may assume \SCALA{N\%p = 0}); each
process should work on \SCALA{height = N/p} rows.  (Each process may use an
\SCALA{N} by \SCALA{N} array to store the labels, but will only work on a part
of the array.)  

The worker processes should communicate by message passing only: they may use
no shared variables except they may all read the array~\SCALA{a}.  They may
use a barrier synchronisation to determine if they can terminate.

You should give the definition of a worker, and state carefully what you
assume about any channels you use, but do not need to give an explicit
definition of how the system is constructed. 

%%%%%

\item
Now suppose a barrier synchronisation operation is not available.  Describe
the changes necessary to your code.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
(a) Well assume buffered channels with capacity~1, connected as the names
  suggest.
%
\begin{scala}
// Type of messages, one row of array
type Msg = Array[Coord]

// Combining barrier
def and(b1:Boolean,b2:Boolean) = b1 && b2
val barrier = new CombiningBarrier(p, true, and);

def Worker(me: Int, sendUp: ![Msg], sendDown: ![Msg], 
           receiveUp: ?[Msg], receiveDown: ?[Msg]) 
= proc("Worker"+me){
  // This worker deals with rows [start .. end)
  val start = me*height; val end = start+height;

  val myLabels = new Array[Array[Coord]](N, N);
  for(i <- 0 until N; j <- 0 until N) 
    if(a(i)(j)) myLabels(i)(j) = (i, j);

  var done = false;

  while(!done){
    var myDone = true;
    // Update coordinates
    for(i <- start until end; j <- 0 until N){
      if(a(i)(j)){
        for( (i1, j1) <- neighbours(i,j) )
          if(a(i1)(j1) && 
             smaller(myLabels(i1)(j1), myLabels(i)(j))){
            myLabels(i)(j) = myLabels(i1)(j1); myDone = false;
          }
      }
    }
    // Distribute top and bottom rows   
    if(me!=0) sendUp! myLabels(start).toArray; 
    if(me!=p-1) sendDown! myLabels(end-1).toArray;
    // Receive new top and bottom rows
    if(me!=0) myLabels(start-1) = receiveDown?;
    if(me!=p-1) myLabels(end) = receiveUp?;
    done = barrier.sync(myDone);
  }
}
\end{scala}
%
[The call to \SCALA{toArray} creates a fresh copy of the array, to avoid
  sharing.] 

%%%%%

(b) We piggy-back the booleans indicating whether processes can terminate onto
the data.  Define the type of messages by
%
\begin{SCALA}
type Msg = Tuple2[Array[Coord], Boolean];
\end{SCALA}
%
And replace the data-passing and global synchronisation by
%
\begin{scala}
if(me==0){
  // Send my bottom row
  sendDown! (myLabels(end-1).toArray, myDone); 
  val (newBelow, b2) = receiveUp?;  // Receive new row below
  myLabels(end) = newBelow; done = b2;
}
else if(me==p-1){
  val (newAbove, b1) = receiveDown?; // Receive new row above
  myLabels(start-1) = newAbove; done = b1 && myDone;
  sendUp! (myLabels(start).toArray, done); // Send my top row
}
else{
  val (newAbove, b1) = receiveDown?; // Receive new row above
  myLabels(start-1) = newAbove;
  // Send my bottom row
  sendDown! (myLabels(end-1).toArray, myDone && b1); 
  val (newBelow, b2) = receiveUp?;  // Receive new row below
  myLabels(end) = newBelow; done = b2;
  sendUp! (myLabels(start).toArray, b2); // Send my top row
}
\end{scala}
%
The bottom rows are passed down, during which the conjunction of the
\SCALA{myDone} variables is calculated; then the top rows are passed up with
the final value of \SCALA{done}.
\end{answer}
