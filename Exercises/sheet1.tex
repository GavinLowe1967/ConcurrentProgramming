\begin{document}
\maketitle

You should complete all questions marked \Programming\ at a computer.
%, and include suitable testing code with your answers.

Questions marked $\dagger$ will not normally be discussed in class.  Model
answers are included below.  You should attempt these questions and mark them
yourself; ask your tutor if they would like them to be handed in.

Some of the early questions in this sheet are designed to help you understand
how hard ill-disciplined programs are to understand.
