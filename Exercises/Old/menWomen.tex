\begin{question}
Consider the following synchronisation problem.  There are two types of
process, which we shall call Men and Women.  These processes need to pair off,
one of each type, for some purpose.  A monitor is required, with a procedure
for each type of process.  The procedure should block processes until a
process of the other type is ready, at which point both should continue.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The following monitor was suggested.  Explain why this does not meet the
requirement. 
%
\begin{scala}
object Monitor1{
  var menWaiting = 0; var womenWaiting = 0; 
    // number of men, women currently waiting
  var manCommitted, womanCommitted = false;
    // Have the next man, woman to return been decided but not yet paired?

  def ManEnter = synchronized{
    if(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted){
      menWaiting += 1;
      while(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted) wait(); // wait for a woman
      menWaiting -= 1; womanCommitted = false;
    }
    else{ manCommitted = true; notify(); } // wake up a man
  }

  def WomanEnter = synchronized{
     if(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted){
        womenWaiting += 1;
        while(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted) wait(); // wait for a man
        womenWaiting -= 1; manCommitted = false;
     }
     else{ womanCommitted = true; notify(); } // wake up a woman
  }
}
\end{scala}

\item
Now the following monitor is suggested.  Explain why this doesn't meet the
requirement, either.
%
\begin{scala}
object Monitor2{
  var menWaiting = 0; var womenWaiting = 0; 
    // number of men, women currently waiting
  var manCommitted, womanCommitted = false;
    // Have the next man, woman to return been decided but not yet paired?

  def ManEnter = synchronized{
    if(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted || manCommitted){
      menWaiting += 1;
      while(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted || manCommitted) 
        wait(); // wait for a woman
      menWaiting -= 1; womanCommitted = false;
    }
    else{ manCommitted = true; notifyAll(); } // wake up a man
  }

  def WomanEnter = synchronized{
    if(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted || womanCommitted){
      womenWaiting += 1;
      while(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted || womanCommitted)
        wait(); // wait for a man
      womenWaiting -= 1; manCommitted = false;
    }
    else{ womanCommitted = true; notifyAll(); } // wake up a woman
  }
}
\end{scala}

\item
Suggest a definition for the module that does meet the requirement.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}


  /*
  This doesn't work. 

  1. A man enters and waits (so menWaiting = 1)

  2. A woman enters, finds menWaiting>0, so sets womanCommitted = true, does
  notify() and exits;

  3. A second woman enters, finds menWaiting>0, so sets womanCommitted = true,
  does notify() and exits.

  So the poor man ends up with two women.
  */

  /*
  This doesn't work either.

  1. Men 1 and 2 enter and wait (so menWaiting = 2).

  2. Woman 3 enters, finds menWaiting>0, so sets womanCommitted = true, does
  notifyAll() and exits.

  3. Woman 4 enters (before any man is scheduled), and waits (since
  womanCommitted = true), setting womenWaiting = 1.

  4. Man 1 is scheduled, sets womanCommitted = false, menWaiting = 1, and
  exits (paired with woman 3).

  5. Man 2 is scheduled, finds womenWaiting = 1 and so exits.

  So poor woman 3 ends up with two men.
  */

  object Monitor3{
    var menWaiting = 0; var womenWaiting = 0; 
      // number of men, women currently waiting
    var manCommitted, womanCommitted = false;
      // Have the next man, woman to return been decided but not yet paired?

    def ManEnter = synchronized{
      menWaiting += 1;
      while(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted || manCommitted) 
	wait(); // wait for a woman
      menWaiting -= 1; manCommitted = true; 
      if(!womanCommitted) notifyAll() 
      else{ manCommitted = false; womanCommitted = false; }
//       println("Man exits (1); "+menWaiting+"\t"+womenWaiting+"\t"+
// 	      manCommitted+"\t"+womanCommitted)
    }
