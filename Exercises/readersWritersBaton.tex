\begin{question}
\Programming\ Implement a solution to the readers and writers problem using
semaphores and the technique of passing the baton.  Think carefully about whom
the baton should be passed to in different scenarios in each of the following
scenarios: when a reader enters; when a writer enters; when a reader leaves;
when a writer leaves.
\end{question}

%%%%%

\begin{answer}
\begin{itemize}
\item When a reader enters we pass the baton to another waiting reader if
  there is one; otherwise we lift the mutex to allow other processes to run.

\item When a writer enters we just lift the mutex (no other process can be
  allowed in).

\item When a reader leaves we pass the baton to a writer if we can (i.e.~if
  there are no readers in the database and there is a writer waiting) to
  provide a form of fairness; otherwise we just lift the mutex.

\item When a writer leaves we pass the baton to a reader if there is one
  waiting (to provide a form a fairness); otherwise we pass to the baton to a
  writer if there is one waiting; otherwise we just lift the mutex.
\end{itemize}

\begin{scala}
object RWController{
  private var readers = 0; private var writers = 0;
  // Number of readers, writers currently using database
  // Invariant: writers = 1 && readers = 0 || writers = 0

  private var readersWaiting, writersWaiting = 0;
  // Number of readers, writers waiting

  private val readerWait, writerWait = new Semaphore;
  readerWait.down; writerWait.down;
  // Semaphores for readers, writers to wait on

  private val mutex = new Semaphore; // semaphore to protect variables

  private def Report = { 
    println("readers="+readers+"; readersWaiting = "+readersWaiting); 
  }
    
  def ReaderEnter = {
    mutex.down; println("Reader trying");
    if(writers>0){ 
      readersWaiting += 1; mutex.up; 
      readerWait.down; // wait to be woken
      readersWaiting -= 1; readers+=1; Report; 
      if (readersWaiting>0) readerWait.up; // wake up next reader
      else mutex.up
    }
    else{ readers+=1; Report; mutex.up; }
  }

  def WriterEnter = { 
    mutex.down; println("Writer trying");
    if(readers>0 || writers>0){ 
      writersWaiting += 1; mutex.up; 
      writerWait.down; // wait to be woken
      writersWaiting -= 1; 
    }
    writers = 1; println("Writer entering"); mutex.up; 
  }

  def ReaderLeave = {
    mutex.down; 
    readers -= 1; Report; 
    if(readers==0 && writersWaiting>0) writerWait.up; // wake up writer
    else mutex.up; 
  }
      
  def WriterLeave = { 
    mutex.down;
    writers = 0; println("Writer leaving"); 
    if (readersWaiting>0) readerWait.up; // give priority to waking up reader
    else if (writersWaiting>0) writerWait.up; // wake up writer
    else mutex.up;
  }
}
