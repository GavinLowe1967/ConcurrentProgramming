\Large\bf Notes on past exam papers
\end{center}

This note gives a brief comparison between previous exam papers and the
current syllabus.  I taught the course between 2009 and 2011, and Bernard
Sufrin taught it between 2012 and 2018, so the former papers are more likely
to be indicative of my style; however, my thinking on the subject has
developed since then.  Note that the exam will be fair to students who
attended lectures in either 2018 or 2019.

\begin{itemize}
\item Previous exam papers placed more emphasis on the closing of channels
  than we have this year: either to signal the end of an input stream, or to
  indicate that a consumer is unwilling to receive more input.

\item This year I have placed more emphasis on concurrent datatypes than in
  previous years.

\item Monitors were added to CSO in 2016; prior to then, ``monitor'' meant JVM
  monitor, but you might choose whether to use a CSO monitor or a JVM monitor
  with such questions.

\item For some questions involving semaphores, the operations are called
  |acquire| and |release|, rather then |down| and |up|.

\item Question 1 from 2015 requires the use of a timeout within an |alt| or
  |serve|, which is a construct we haven't used this year.  Here's an
  indicative example:
\begin{scala}
  alt(
    c =?=> { x => println(x+" received") }
    | after(1000) ==> { println("Timeout") }
  )
\end{scala}
