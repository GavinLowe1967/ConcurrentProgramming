\begin{question}
CSO channels are rather like CSP events.  Describe one or two ways in
which they are different.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
CSP processes are defined in terms of events, and so CSP does not distinguish
between input and output (although there are constructs that behave like input
and output); however, channels in CSO are uni-directional, and so input and
output are distinguished.  This means that if a CSO process is willing to
input from a channel, it should be willing to input an arbitrary value; there
is no equivalent of the CSP selective input, e.g. $in?x:A \then \ldots$.

Also, CSO communications are always synchronisations between exactly two
processes, whereas in CSP any number of processes can synchronise on an
event.
