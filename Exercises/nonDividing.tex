\begin{nontutequestion}
In the numerical integration example, we assumed that the number $n$ of
intervals was divisible by the number $ntasks$ of tasks.  How can
we remove this assumption?

\begin{nontuteanswer}
The easiest thing to do is to make most tasks of size $\lceil n/ntasks
\rceil$, and to make the last task appropriately smaller.  Making the last
task smaller is likely to make the overall computation finish faster.

It is possible to use a more sophisticated scheme, where all the tasks are of
size $\lceil n/ntasks \rceil$ or $\lfloor n/ntasks \rfloor$, but, frankly,
these don't give any benefits.
