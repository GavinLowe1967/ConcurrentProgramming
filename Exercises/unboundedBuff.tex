\begin{question}
% \Programming\
Implement an unbounded buffer as a process:
%
\begin{scala}
def buff[T](in: ?[T], out: ![T]) = proc{ ... }
\end{scala}
%
The process should always be willing to input on \SCALA{in}; it should output
data on \SCALA{out} in the order in which they were received, and should be
willing to output whenever it has input data that have not yet been output. 

{\bf Hint:} you might want to use an instance of a
\SCALA{scala.collection.mutable.Queue} to store the current values held in the
buffer.
\end{question}

\begin{scala}
  def buff[T](in: ?[T], out: ![T]) = proc{
    var queue = new scala.collection.mutable.Queue[T]

    serve(
      in =?=> { x => queue.enqueue(x) }
      | (queue.nonEmpty && out) =!=> { queue.dequeue }
    )
  }
\end{scala}
%
We will discuss testing of datatypes like this later in the course.  For the
moment, I would expect to see some testing involving some threads passing in
pre-defined sequences of values, and other threads taking the outputs and
writing them into global variables, and then checking that the outputs are a
permutation of the inputs.
