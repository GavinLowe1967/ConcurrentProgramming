In graph search, use undirected graph.  Can avoid final loop
(absorbing extra messages) by remembering which nodes have sent us a
message we rejected, and not subsequently sending them a message.
Consider loop of messages A -> B -> C -> A.  With neither, A would
send subsequent message to C which would be blocked.  With this
change, A won't send to C.
