\begin{question}
Consider the following synchronisation problem.  There are two types of
process, which we shall call Men and Women.  These processes need to pair off
for some purpose, with each pair containing one process of each type.  A
monitor is required, with a procedure for each type of process.  The procedure
should block processes until a process of the other type is ready, at which
point both should continue.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The following monitor was suggested.  Explain why this does not meet the
requirement. 
%
\begin{scala}
object Monitor1{
  var menWaiting = 0; var womenWaiting = 0; 
    // number of men, women currently waiting
  var manCommitted, womanCommitted = false;
    // Have the next man, woman to return been decided 
    // but not yet paired?

  def ManEnter = synchronized{
    if(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted){
      menWaiting += 1;
      while(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted) 
        wait(); // wait for a woman
      menWaiting -= 1; womanCommitted = false;
    }
    else{ 
      manCommitted = true; notify();  // wake up a man
    }
  }

  def WomanEnter = synchronized{
     if(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted){
        womenWaiting += 1;
        while(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted) 
          wait(); // wait for a man
        womenWaiting -= 1; manCommitted = false;
     }
     else{ 
       womanCommitted = true; notify(); // wake up a woman
     }
  }
}
\end{scala}

\item
Now the following monitor is suggested.  Explain why this doesn't meet the
requirement, either.
%
\begin{scala}
object Monitor2{
  var menWaiting = 0; var womenWaiting = 0; 
    // number of men, women currently waiting
  var manCommitted, womanCommitted = false;
    // Have the next man, woman to return been decided 
    // but not yet paired?

  def ManEnter = synchronized{
    if(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted || manCommitted){
      menWaiting += 1;
      while(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted 
            || manCommitted) 
        wait(); // wait for a woman
      menWaiting -= 1; womanCommitted = false;
    }
    else{ 
      manCommitted = true; notifyAll();  // wake up a man
    }
  }

  def WomanEnter = synchronized{
    if(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted || womanCommitted){
      womenWaiting += 1;
      while(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted
            || womanCommitted)
        wait(); // wait for a man
      womenWaiting -= 1; manCommitted = false;
    }
    else{ 
      womanCommitted = true; notifyAll(); // wake up a woman
    }
  }
}
\end{scala}

\item
Suggest a definition for the module that does meet the requirement.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Consider the following execution.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A man enters and waits (so \SCALA{menWaiting = 1}).

\item
A woman enters, finds \SCALA{menWaiting>0}, so sets \SCALA{womanCommitted =
  true}, does \SCALA{notify()} and exits.

\item
A second woman enters, before the waiting man is scheduled, finds
\SCALA{menWaiting>0}, so sets \SCALA{womanCommitted = true}, does
\SCALA{notify()} and exits.

\item
Eventually the man is scheduled and exits.
\end{enumerate}
%
So the poor man ends up with two women.  The point is that the second woman
has no way of knowing that another woman has already paired off with the man. 

%%%%%

\item
Consider the following execution.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Men 1 and 2 enter and wait (so \SCALA{menWaiting = 2}).

\item
Woman 3 enters, finds \SCALA{menWaiting>0}, so sets \SCALA{womanCommitted =
  true}, does \SCALA{notifyAll()} and exits.

\item
Woman 4 enters (before any man is scheduled), and waits (since
\SCALA{womanCommitted = true}), setting \SCALA{womenWaiting = 1}.

\item
Man 1 is scheduled, sets \SCALA{womanCommitted = false}, \SCALA{menWaiting =
  1}, and exits (paired with woman 3).

\item
Man 2 is scheduled, finds \SCALA{womenWaiting = 1} and so exits.
\end{enumerate}
%
So poor woman 3 ends up with two men.  The point is that man 2 should wake up
woman 4.

\item
I think the following version works.  Each process tests (in the final
\SCALA{if} statement) whether it is the first or second of the pair to be
woken. 
%
\begin{scala}
object Monitor3{
  var menWaiting = 0; var womenWaiting = 0; 
    // number of men, women currently waiting
  var manCommitted, womanCommitted = false;
    // Have the next man, woman to return been decided 
    // but not yet paired?

  def ManEnter = synchronized{
    menWaiting += 1;
    while(womenWaiting==0 && !womanCommitted || manCommitted) 
      wait(); // wait for a woman
    menWaiting -= 1; manCommitted = true; 
    if(!womanCommitted) notifyAll() 
    else{ manCommitted = false; womanCommitted = false; }
  }

  def WomanEnter = synchronized{
    womenWaiting += 1;
    while(menWaiting==0 && !manCommitted || womanCommitted) 
      wait(); // wait for a woman
    womenWaiting -= 1; womanCommitted = true; 
    if(!manCommitted) notifyAll() 
    else{ manCommitted = false; womanCommitted = false; }
  }
}
\end{scala}
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
